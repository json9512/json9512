    - How does a processor work
    - Heap, Stack memory
    - How does the web work
    - OSI layers
    - What is a kernel
    
2. Choose 1, 2 or 3 programming and learn how it works
    - How does its grabage collector work
    - Is it parallelizable by nature
    - Where is it used
    
3. Learn how to write efficient code

4. Learn how to document things

5. Learn how to present | communicate your ideas | situation | progress :star::star::star: 
      
### Backend
1. Recap the basics

    - asynchronous
    - Promise / callbacks
    
2. Learn SQL
3. Learn how to test & debug a server :star:
    - Proper logging
4. Learn basic backend functionalities
    - Authentication & Authorization 
    - SSL/TLS
    - Oauth2.0
    - Persistence
    - Core service logic
    - Cache, Session, Tokens
    - API
    - Routing
    - Linking database
    
5. Learn how to scale services
    - Load balancers
    - Metrics for scaling
    - Maintaining persistence on distributed instances
    
6. Learn how to divide a service into a cluster of micro services
    - Managing pipelines efficiently

### DevOps
1. Recap the basics
    - What are containers
    - Some CI/CD tools
    - What is container management
    - VPNs
    - Proxies
    - How is the machine structured eg. physical, kernel, os, application
    
2. Learn how to setup automated tests and deployment Travis, Jenkins, AWS
3. Learn how to setup environments
4. Learn how to use Docker, Kubernetes, Nginx
5. Not much info.... learn more at a company

### Network Security
1. Recap the basics
    - Firewall
    - Encryption symmetric, asymmetric
    - public, private key
    - Ports
    - OWASP 10 vulnerabilities
    - Linux/Windows
    - Bash :star:
    - Routing, configuring routers and switches
2. Learn how to create firewalls
    - packet forwarding
    - blacklist, whitelist
3. Learn how to setup network
    - specific ports
    - Bastions
    - VPNs 
4. Learn how to secure a machine
    - SSL/TLS 
    - user authentication & authorization
    - encryption algorithms SHA256, MD5
5. Learn how to schedule tasks on OS
6. Learn penetration techniques and tools
    - enumeration techniques
    - nmap, gobuster, johntheripper etc
7. Learn how to write security reports
    
### ML/DL
1. Recap the basics
    - Gradient descent
    - Overfitting, underfitting
    - Data balancing
    - Splitting dataset
    - Hyper parameter fine tuning
    - optimizers
    - Linear regression
    - Classification
    
2. Learn how to visualize results
3. Learn how to create models introduced in research papers
4. Learn how reknown DL architectures work
    - CNN & RNN
    - GAN
    - LSTM
    - Transformers
5. Learn how to implement a model as a service
6. Learn how to pipeline the model with other services eg. logging, visualization
7. Learn the security aspects of the models
      - Adversarial, poison attacks etc
8. Learn how reinforcement learning works (Pretty difficult to use in real service -> too much computation)

### Interactive web
1. Recap the basics
    - JS using DOMs
    - CSS layouts
    - HTML
2. Code what you have in mind
3. Learn frameworks: d3js, threejs, etc
